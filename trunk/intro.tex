\section{Goal of this deliverable}
\label{sec:goal-of-this-deliverable}

The goal of this deliverable is to document every development and integration practice we agree on in order to facilitate the development process between partners.  Since we want to offer maximum freedom in the choice of technologies of each component, this deliverable will focus on tools and processes for easing collaboration.  We will address source repositories, bug tracking system, documentation and continuous integration.

\section{Structure of the deliverable}
\label{sec:structure-of-the-deliverable}

In the Section~\ref{ch:preamble}, we will justify the choice of an SOA architecture for our LearnPAd platform and discuss the general choices related to open sources and closed sources development.  Section~\ref{ch:development-components} will be a general view of the development process, detailing the transitional steps from the first lines of codes to the publication of a stable version.  Section~\ref{ch:developement-process} will develop and detail each of these transitional steps, mainly in term of practices with some example of technical solutions to support them.  The integration plan will be detailed in section~\ref{ch:integration-plan}.
